    <description>
      The whole-body controller simultaneously runs multiple controllers in task space. It integrates their outputs
      into the cost function of a quadratic program (QP). The solution of the QP is the robot's joint position,
      velocity, acceleration or torque, which regulates all tasks simulaneously, while considering the physical constraints
      of the robot.
